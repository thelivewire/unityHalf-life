# unityHalf-life
open half-life goldsrc bsp in Unity3d 


based on uQuake1 by mikezila https://github.com/mikezila/uQuake1

Contains lighmap code from Paul Higinbotham http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/32751/Half-Life-Game-Level-Viewer http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx


code needs a lot of tidying, the lightmaps seem to be a little off.

To use place wads & bsp in the asset folders, and set the map name in the gameobject.
